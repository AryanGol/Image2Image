# 🧠 U-Net for Image-to-Image Translation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a **U-Net convolutional neural network** for **image-to-image translation** — a deep learning approach that learns to map an input image to a corresponding output image.  
It can be applied to tasks such as **image segmentation**, **denoising**, **super-resolution**, **style transfer**, or **satellite-to-map** translation.

## 🚀 Overview

The notebook implements:
- A **U-Net architecture** with encoder–decoder structure and skip connections.  
- **Image preprocessing and augmentation** for training stability.  
- **Model training** using PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on implementation).  
- **Visualization of predictions** to assess translation quality.  
- **Loss and metric tracking** during training.

## 🧩 U-Net Architecture

The **U-Net** consists of:
- **Encoder (Contracting Path):** successive convolutional + pooling layers capturing context.  
- **Decoder (Expanding Path):** upsampling layers reconstructing spatial resolution.  
- **Skip connections** linking encoder and decoder layers for fine-grained detail recovery.
